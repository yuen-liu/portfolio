            Update #1: I&apos;ve found my internal conviction.
          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-neutral-700 font-medium mb-6">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I&apos;m dropping the pre-med path. Going to pave my path in AI in drug discovery.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            <em className="text-neutral-600">Long story (skip if you don&apos;t want to read my rambling thoughts):</em> In 8th grade, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor—it was painful,
            shocking, and life-altering for my entire family. That was the moment I knew I wanted to work in the life sciences or healthcare;
            when I knew I wanted to make an impact by saving lives. Up until now, I&apos;ve been playing with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon,
            all whilst knowing I love to build.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            But this summer, as my research in protein modeling has progressed, I&apos;ve realized that what gets me up in the morning
            isn&apos;t the idea of becoming a doctor. It&apos;s my dream of becoming an innovator by using AI in drug discovery.
            I can make the same, if not more, impact on people&apos;s lives—push out better, cheaper drugs: faster.
            And maybe I&apos;ll be the next SandboxAQ or DeepMind or Insilico or Chai founder???
            (But then again, as Professor Sam Sternberg told me today, life is stochastic; who knows what will happen?)
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            So now that I&apos;ve finally resolved my struggles—which means I don&apos;t need to waste time working as a medical assistant (not to say that job isn&apos;t important; MA&apos;s play such a vital role in the healthcare system)
            or studying for the MCAT anymore—I can focus my all on what I love: drug discovery models.
            For now, that means researching the mechanistic interpretability of ESM-2
            (in layman&apos;s terms: uncovering how the freak the &quot;black box&quot; of protein language models works).
            I&apos;m also trying to reimplement a DeepChem model for fun, so we&apos;ll see how that goes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-neutral-700">
            Anyways, #good stuff. Very excited to be in the lab I&apos;m at and honestly to be alive on this planet in an era of innovation :)

            One of my goals this summer was to meet 100 interesting (new) people. As of Aug 5, 2025 I&apos;ve hit the 50 person benchmark and very, very glad to say I&apos;ve made some amazing friends along the way :D
